# Timeflow

Timeflow is a simple timer app designed with psychology-based incentive features to help users stay motivated while managing their time. It uses positive reinforcement and rewards to encourage productive habits.

## Project Structure

This project contains two main folders:

- **frontend**: Contains the front-end code for the user interface of the app.
- **backend**: Contains the back-end code that manages the server, database, and other functionalities.

### Instructions for Running the Project

1. **Frontend**: To start the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` folder and run the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the front-end development server.

2. **Backend**: To start the backend, navigate to the `backend` folder and run:

   ```
   node ./server.js
   ```

   This will start the backend server.

   You can find these instructions in the `package.json` file.

## Database Setup

Timeflow uses a PostgreSQL database to store user data and reward information. Currently, you need to install PostgreSQL on your PC to set up the database.
